# **💼 Salary Insights Web Application**

A full-stack web application built as part of my academic project, this tool enables users to analyze, predict, and evaluate salaries based on real-world datasets. It helps individuals understand salary expectations across job roles, experience levels, and locations — through a simple, clean, and responsive UI.

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project was developed to solve a common pain point: "Am I being paid fairly?"

Instead of manually going through job portals and aggregating numbers, this application provides an automated and insightful solution that:

Help job seekers and employees compare their current salaries with industry trends.

Uses data filtering and visualization to highlight how different factors (like location, experience, or role) affect compensation.

Predicts expected salary using a machine learning model trained on actual datasets.

Offers a salary calculator tool for self-evaluation.

All three features — Analysis, Prediction, and Calculator — are bundled into a single web interface using modern web technologies.

## **🎯 Objectives**
To develop an interactive platform that bridges the gap between raw salary data and actionable insights.

To integrate real-time analysis with predictive capabilities using Python logic and ML.

To provide users with clarity and transparency in compensation benchmarking.
